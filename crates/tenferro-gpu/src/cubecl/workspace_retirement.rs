//! Deferred retirement of vendor device workspaces.
//!
//! A retired workspace returns its CubeCL handle to the shared pool, so the
//! handle may only be released once the vendor work that used it has completed
//! on its stream. `Workspace::drop` used to synchronize that stream, which
//! drains the pipeline: `gpu/tensornetwork` trace execution spent 54% of each
//! call with the device idle between kernels because plan-cache eviction
//! synchronized once per evicted workspace.
//!
//! Retirement instead records a CUDA event on the workspace's stream and
//! releases the handle once the event reports completion. The event is the
//! completion witness that the stream barrier provided before, so a block is
//! still never returned to the pool while vendor work may reference it.
